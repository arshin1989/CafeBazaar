**CafeBazaar Data And Analysis**



With more than 45,000,000 users, 180,000 applications, and 56,000 developers , CafeBazaar is undoubtedly the largest android market in Iran. 
In this repository, you can download scraped data from cafebazaar.ir in the dataset folder.  These data have been extracted until 20 March 2021. Also, you can see some EDA on these data on 2-CafeBazaar-DataAnalysis-Part1 file. As I use the Plotly library, use the HTML file to see the plots.
I should point out that most of the dataset and analysis output is in Persian.
